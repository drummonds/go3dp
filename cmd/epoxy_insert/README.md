# Epoxy insert

This is designed as an insert into a wall.  The wall is of uncertain construction as it has been lath and plaster and has then been filled.  The old plastboard compression have come loose.

The idea is to make a plastic tube with rough edges which is closed and will accept a 4mm insert.  Then drill ca 8mm hole and epoxy it into the wall.

Going to see if it works.
