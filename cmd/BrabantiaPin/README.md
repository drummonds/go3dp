# Brabantia Pin

This is to create a pin to fit old Brabantia touch lids 40l/50l that don't have and insert.

There is a person on ebay that make makes and sells an insert that you can slide in https://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/176104133254

My plan is to make a pin and then fix it in place with a 3d doodler and using PETG

This worked and is in place.  A little stiff.

The new library github.com/soypat/gsdfn has some problems with rendering.  Seems to be not lining up cubes and leaving holes.
